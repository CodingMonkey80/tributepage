            <li><strong>January 17, 2016</strong> - Although strongly debated T. J. loses his title to former titleholder Dominick Cruz in the main event via split decision. Both fighters went on to win ‘Fight of the night’</li>

            <li><strong>November 4, 2017</strong> - It’s fight night in MSG in New York UFC 217. There are 3 title fights on the cards including the return of former middleweight champion GSP. Many considered the bantamweight title fight between Dillashaw and Cody Garbrandt to be the real main event. For 2 years T. J. Dillashaw has been vilified and attacked for leaving Team Alpha Male so the bantamweight match between T. J. and his ex team mate Cody Garbrandt is almost poetic. The trash talk between both sides helped promote this fight and the genuine animosity between the pair has the world in hype mode. After being dropped at the end of the first round and wobbling back to his corner T. J. comes out and stays out of range of Garbrandts dangerous right hook. Garbrandt is dropped with a head kick but recovers quickly and then in a toe to toe exchange where either contender could have got knocked out, Dillashaw's fist connects with Garbandts jaw folding the title holder in half. Dillashaw with his killer instinct kneels on the dazed title holder and delivers a vicious ground and pound winning the title he should have never lost via KO and once again wins ‘Performance of the night’</li>  
          </ul>
